# pongjs
Simple multiplayer ping-pong game written in `CoffeeScript`, `LESS` and `Jade`.

First of all you need to install all Node JS project dependencies.
```sh
$ npm install
```
To build the project we are using `grunt`.

You can build in debug mode by simply writing:
```sh
$ grunt dev
```
Or you can build directly in production mode using:
```sh
$ grunt dist
```

If you don't have grunt installed, you can install it globally (In most cases you need to run this as `root`)
```sh
$ sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
```

To run the server, just type:
```sh
$ npm start
```
